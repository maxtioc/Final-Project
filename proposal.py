#my project will be a tank battle in which two tanks fire at one another until one is destroyed
#I plan to make the game turn-based
#my first major milestone will be generating two tanks that each move
#the first part that I do not know how to do is alternating turns after a given tank fires
#I also need to learn how to make the projectile fire where the mouse is and vary power of shot
#this project may be too ambitious in that I do not know pygame and i need to apply gravity to the bullet
#it may not be ambitious enough in that it should be relatively simple once I learn everything I do not know
